# MERN Chat App

This is a real-time chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack with Socket.IO for real-time communication. The app supports features like private and group chats, user authentication, and real-time messaging. Future enhancements will include live audio and video calls, file attachments, and more.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a fully functional real-time chat application that provides a seamless and responsive user experience. This includes:

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Instant messaging between users with real-time updates using Socket.IO.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Scalable Architecture:** A scalable and maintainable codebase, with separate frontend and backend components.

## Future Goals

The project is under active development, with the following features planned for future releases:

- **Live Audio/Video Calls:** Integration of WebRTC for real-time audio and video communication.
- **File Attachments:** Support for sending and receiving files, images, GIFs, and other media types within the chat.
- **Message Reactions:** Users will be able to react to messages with emojis.
- **Enhanced Group Chat Features:** Including group admins, custom notifications, and more.
- **Push Notifications:** Real-time push notifications for new messages and other activities.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- **backend/** - Contains the Node.js/Express backend code and APIs.
- **frontend/** - Contains the React.js frontend code.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KalamPinjar/Chat_MERN.git
cd mern-chat-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following script to install all the dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Use the following command to start the backend server & frontend :

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Launch the Application

After starting the backend and frontend with the above mentioned command can be accessed by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

### 5. Production Build

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This script will:

- Install all required dependencies for both the backend and frontend.
- Build the frontend assets and place them in the appropriate directory for serving.

## Scripts Overview

- **`server`**: Starts the backend server using Nodemon for hot-reloading during development.
- **`start`**: Starts the backend server without Nodemon.
- **`build`**: Installs all dependencies and builds the frontend for production.
